### Risk Finance

The code starts by loading the necessary libraries for the Shiny app to run: shiny, mvtnorm, and psych.

Next, a function called risk.sim() is defined. This function takes in an input vector containing three correlation values for the revenue, variable cost, and fixed cost factors. The function then generates 1000 sets of random numbers based on these correlations using the rmvt() function from the mvtnorm package. These random numbers are transformed into the corresponding revenue, variable cost, and fixed cost values using the inverse cumulative distribution functions (qgamma(), qbeta(), and qt()) for the gamma, beta, and Student's t distributions, respectively. The revenue, variable cost, and fixed cost values are then used to calculate the total cost and operating margin for each set. The function returns a data frame containing the revenue, total cost, and operating margin for each set.

The UI server is defined next. It consists of a title panel and a sidebar layout. The sidebar panel contains three slider inputs, each corresponding to the three correlation values needed by the risk.sim() function. The sliderInput() function is used to create each slider input. The main panel contains a plot output called pairs.1.

The server is defined next. It contains one output called pairs.1, which is defined using the renderPlot() function. This function calls the risk.sim() function with the three correlation values obtained from the slider inputs provided by the user. The output of risk.sim() is then plotted using the pairs.panels() function from the psych package.
